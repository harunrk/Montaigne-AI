I created this project to put into practice what I learned about convolutional neural networks. The purpose of the project is to determine whether the brain is tumorous or not, and if so, what type of tumor it is, using provided brain MRI images. I trained my model using the [Brain Tumor Classification (MRI)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri) dataset available on Kaggle. Additionally, I utilized the [EfficientNetB0](https://ayyucekizrak.medium.com/%C3%B6l%C3%A7eklendirme-ile-cnn-modelinin-do%C4%9Fruluk-ve-verimlili%C4%9Fini-art%C4%B1rma-efficientnet-cb6f2b6512de
) model, which employs weights from the ImageNet dataset, to train my model faster and achieve more accurate results. After training the model, I tested it with test data and compared the results using a confusion matrix.
